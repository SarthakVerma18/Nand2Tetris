# Nand2Tetris

This repository contains my solutions and implementations from the Nand2Tetris course â€” a journey from basic logic gates all the way to building a full computer system from scratch.<br/>

## Overview
The Nand2Tetris course takes a bottom-up approach to computer architecture. Starting from a single NAND gate, it gradually builds up to a working CPU and operating system capable of running programs written in a high-level language.<br/>

## Implemented Projects
Project 1: Logic Gates<br/>
Implemented basic logic gates like AND, OR, NOT, XOR using only NAND.<br/>

Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic<br/>
Built half-adders, full-adders, and the 16-bit ALU.<br/>

Project 3: Sequential Logic<br/>
Designed flip-flops, registers, RAM modules, and a program counter.<br/>

Project 4: Machine Language<br/>
Wrote and tested programs in the Hack assembly language.<br/>

Project 5: Computer Architecture<br/>
Constructed the Hack CPU by wiring the ALU and control logic.<br/>

Project 6: Assembler<br/>
Built a two-pass assembler in Python to translate Hack assembly code into binary.<br/>

Project 7+: (WIP)<br/>
Higher-level language implementation, compiler, and operating system components.<br/>
